# DST Mods

Hub for all my DST ([Don't Starve Together](https://store.steampowered.com/app/322330/Dont_Starve_Together/)) mods.

Note that many of these mods are derived from existing work and patched to support newer DST versions.
Most mods do not come with a license, but I am going by the "Modding Etiquette" seen [here](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=441378551).

Details for each mod exist in their respective folders.

## Codename τ

My mods are mainly updates on existing mods. Since there are so many tags (Updated, Reborn, New), I decided to tag my own mods τ (tau).
Tau represents life, radians per full circle rotation in math, and DST - DS in fake math. More importantly, no other mod uses tau in their tags.
